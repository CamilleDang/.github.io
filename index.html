    <h2>Project 1</h1>
    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>This project is based on coloring the Prokudin-Gorskii photo collection! 
        Sergei Mikhailovich Prokudin-Gorskii was convinced that there would eventually be colored photos.
        So in the early 1900s, he took a bunch of pictures, recording three exposures of every scene he took
        onto a glass plate using a red, green, and blue filter. He never got to piece them together, but we can now!
