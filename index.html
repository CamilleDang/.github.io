    <h2>Project 1</h1>
    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>This project is based on bringing color to the Prokudin-Gorskii photo collection.
        Sergei Mikhailovich Prokudin-Gorskii was convinced that there would eventually be colored photos.
        So in the early 1900s, he took a bunch of pictures, recording three exposures of every scene he took
        onto a glass plate using a red, green, and blue filter. He never got to piece them together to make a colored image, but we can now!
    </p>
    <h3>Naive Approach</h3>
    <p> I first started by taking each image (which has the 'red', 'green', and 'blue' filtered images stacked upon each other) and extracting the three separate images.
        Then, I created an align function that takes in two images, and returns the best x and y offset that minimizes a loss between the first image's position according to the second image,
        essentially ensuring that the closest similarity between the two images as possible. I used the Euclidean distance as my loss function and searched over window sizes of [-15, 15], iteratively
        checking the
